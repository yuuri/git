    C: handle out-of-date reftable stacks
    
    * Make reftable_stack_reload() check out-of-dateness. This makes it very cheap,
      allowing it to be called often. This is useful because Git calls itself often,
      which effectively requires a reload.
    
    * In reftable_stack_add(), check the return value of stack_uptodate(), leading
      to erroneously succeeding the transaction.
    
    * A test that exercises the above.
